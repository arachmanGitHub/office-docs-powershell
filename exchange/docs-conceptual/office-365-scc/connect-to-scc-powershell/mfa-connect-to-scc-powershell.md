# Connect to Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center PowerShell using multi-factor authentication
If your account uses multi-factor authentication (MFA) or federated authentication, you can't use the instructions at [Connect to Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center PowerShell](connect-to-scc-powershell.md) to use remote PowerShell to connect to the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center. Instead, you need to install the Exchange Online Remote PowerShell Module, and use the **Connect-IPPSSession** cmdlet to connect to Security &amp; Compliance Center PowerShell.
  
> [!NOTE]
> You can't use the Exchange Online Remote PowerShell Module to connect to Exchange Online PowerShell and Security &amp; Compliance Center PowerShell in the same session (window). You need to use separate sessions of the Exchange Online Remote PowerShell Module. 
  
## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete: 5 minutes
    
- The Exchange Online Remote PowerShell Module needs to be installed on your computer. If your installed version of the Exchange Online Remote PowerShell Module doesn't have the **Connect-IPPSSession** cmdlet, you need to install the latest version of the module:
    
  1. Open the Exchange admin center (EAC) for your Exchange Online organization. For instructions, see [Exchange Admin Center in Exchange Online](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/ace44f6b-4084-4f9c-89b3-e0317962472b.aspx).
    
  2. In the EAC, go to **Hybrid** > **Setup** and click the appropriate **Configure** button to download the Exchange Online Remote PowerShell Module for multi-factor authentication.
    
     ![Download the Exchange Online PowerShell Module from the Hybrid tab in the EAC](../../media/24645e56-8b11-4c0f-ace4-09bdb2703562.png)

  3. In the **Application Install** window that opens, click **Install**.
    
     ![Click Install in the Exchange Online PowerShell Module window](../../media/0fd389a1-a32d-4e2f-bf5f-78e9b6407d4c.png)
  
- Windows Remote Management (WinRM) on your computer needs to allow basic authentication (it's enabled by default). To verify that basic authentication is enabled, run this command in a Command Prompt:
    
  ```
  winrm get winrm/config/client/auth
  ```

    If you don't see the value  `Basic = true`, you need to run this command from an elevated Command Prompt (a Command Prompt window you open by selecting **Run as administrator**) to enable basic authentication for WinRM:
    
  ```
  winrm set winrm/config/client/auth @{Basic="true"}
  ```

    If basic authentication is disabled, you'll get this error when you try to connect:
    
     `The WinRM client cannot process the request. Basic authentication is currently disabled in the client configuration. Change the client configuration and try the request again.`

## Connect to Security &amp; Compliance Center PowerShell by using MFA or federated authentication

1. On your local computer, open the **Exchange Online Remote PowerShell Module** (**Microsoft Corporation** > **Microsoft Exchange Online Remote PowerShell Module**).
    
2. The command that you need to run uses the following syntax:
    
    ```
    Connect-IPPSSession -UserPrincipalName <UPN> [-ConnectionUri <ConnectionUri> -AzureADAuthorizationEndPointUri <AzureADUri>]
    ```

    -  _\<UPN\>_ is your Office 365 work or school account.
    
    - The  _\<ConnectionUri\>_ and _\<AzureADUri\>_ values depend on the location of your Office 365 organization as described in the following table:
    
    |**Office 365 offering**|**_ConnectionUri_ parameter value**|**_AzureADAuthorizationEndPointUri_ parameter value**|
    |:-----|:-----|:-----|
    |Office 365 |Not used |Not used |
    |Office 365 Germany | `https://ps.compliance.protection.outlook.de/PowerShell-LiveID` | `https://login.microsoftonline.de/common` |
   
    This example connects to the Security &amp; Compliance Center in Office 365 using the account chris@contoso.com.
    
    ```
    Connect-IPPSSession -UserPrincipalName chris@contoso.com
    ```

    This example connects to the Security &amp; Compliance Center in Office 365 Germany using the account lukas@fabrikam.com.
    
    ```
    Connect-IPPSSession -UserPrincipalName lukas@fabrikam.com -ConnectionUri https://ps.compliance.protection.outlook.de/PowerShell-LiveID -AzureADAuthorizationEndPointUri https://login.microsoftonline.de/common
    ```

3. In the sign-in window that opens, enter your password, and then click **Sign in**.
    
     ![Enter your password in the Exchange Online Remote PowerShell window](../../media/b85d80d9-1043-4c7c-8f14-d87d8d56b188.png)
  
    For MFA, a verification code is generated and delivered based on the verification response option that's configured for your account (for example, a text message or the Azure Authenticator app on your mobile phone).
    
4. **(MFA only)**: In the verification window that opens, enter the verification code, and then click **Sign in**.
    
     ![Enter your verification code in the Exchange Online Remote PowerShell window](../../media/d3a405ce-5364-4732-a7bb-2cc9c678da2d.png)
  
## How do you know this worked?

After you sign in, the Security &amp; Compliance Center cmdlets are imported into your Exchange Online Remote PowerShell Module session and tracked by a progress bar. If you don't receive any errors, you connected successfully. A quick test is to run an Security &amp; Compliance Center cmdlet, for example, **Get-RetentionCompliancePolicy**, and see the results.
  
If you receive errors, check the following requirements:
  
- To help prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, you're limited to three open remote PowerShell connections to the Security &amp; Compliance Center.
    
- The account you use to connect to the Security &amp; Compliance Center must be enabled for remote PowerShell. For more information, see [Enable or disable access to Exchange Online PowerShell](../../exchange-online/disable-access-to-exchange-online-powershell.md).
    
- TCP port 80 traffic needs to be open between your local computer and Office 365. It's probably open, but it's something to consider if your organization has a restrictive Internet access policy.
