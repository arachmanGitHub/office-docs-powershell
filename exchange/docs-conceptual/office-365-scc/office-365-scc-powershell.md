# Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center PowerShell
Security &amp; Compliance Center PowerShell is the administrative interface that enables you to manage your Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center settings from the command line. For example, you can use Security &amp; Compliance Center PowerShell to perform Compliance Searches and configure access to the Security &amp; Compliance Center. The following topics provide information about using Security &amp; Compliance Center PowerShell:
  
- To create a remote PowerShell session to the Security &amp; Compliance Center, see [Connect to Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center PowerShell](connect-to-scc-powershell/connect-to-scc-powershell.md). Note that the connection instructions are different from Exchange Online or Exchange Online Protection (the _ConnectionUri_ value is different).
    
- Note that some cmdlets are available only in the Security &amp; Compliance Center. Other cmdlets have the same names and functionality as those in Exchange Online, but they are also available in the Security &amp; Compliance Center.
